# Welcome to my website!

I recently graduated from [MSc Artificial Intelligence][msc_ai] at [Imperial College London][ic] in the Department of Computing. I was co-advised by [Kai Sun][kai_sun] and [Jingqing Zhang][jingqing_zhang] on developing active learning strategy to train clinical report generation models for my master thesis. I hold a [BSc in Statistics, Economics and Finance][bsc_sef] from the Department of Statistics, [University College London][ucl]. 

I am currently working as a pre-doc at the [University of Zurich][uzh] supervised by [Markus Leippold][markus_leippold] on Retrieval Augmented Generation and Hallucination of Large Language Models. **I am starting my [PhD in Data Science][nus_ds] at [National University of Singapore][nus] for 2024 Fall with [President Graduate Fellowship][pgf].**

## Research
        
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Current interests are on several aspects around large language models: 
- Alignment and Hallucination of LLMs
- Evaluation of foundation models -- knowledge, reasoning, helpfulness, etc
- Adversarial Attack on LLMs -- prompt injection techniques
