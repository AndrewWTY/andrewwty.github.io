Welcome to my website!

I recently graduated from [MSc Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/artificial-intelligence/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in the Department of Computing. I was co-advised by [Kai Sun](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.sun) and [Jingqing Zhang](https://jingqingz.github.io/) on developing active learning strategy to train clinical report generation models for my master thesis. I hold a [BSc in Statistics, Economics and Finance](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/statistics-economics-and-finance-bsc) from the Department of Statistics, [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I am currently working as a pre-doc at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) supervised by [Markus Leippold](https://www.df.uzh.ch/en/people/professor/leippold.html) on Retrieval Augmented Generation and Hallucination of Large Language Models. **I am currently looking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2024 or Spring 2025.**

# Research
        
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Current interests are on several aspects around large language models: 
- Alignment and Hallucination of LLMs
- Evaluation of foundation models -- knowledge, reasoning, helpfulness, etc
- Adversarial Attack on LLMs -- prompt injection techniques
